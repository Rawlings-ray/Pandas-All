## Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is a powerful open-source data analysis and manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language. It provides easy-to-use data structures and functions to work with structured data, making it an essential tool for data scientists, analysts, and developers working with data.

In this repository, we cover various aspects of working with Pandas, including:
- Basic data structures: Series and DataFrame
- Data ingestion and export: Reading and writing data from/to various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.)
- Data manipulation: Filtering, selecting, joining, grouping, and reshaping data
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, data normalization, and data type conversion
- Data visualization: Plotting and visualizing data directly from Pandas
- Advanced topics: Time series analysis, merging datasets, handling categorical data, and more

## Installation

Before using Pandas, you'll need to have Python installed on your system.
